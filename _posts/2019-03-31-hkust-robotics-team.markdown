This blog post will introduce you to HKUST Robotics Team!

Robotics team is very popular team among students from Computer Science, Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. It is popular by very strong results achieved each year by their students in different international competitions. The Robotics team was founded in 2003 to interest engineering students in variety of external robotics competitions [[4]][link 4]. Robotics team consists of 3 sub-teams that compete in the [ABU Robocon][5] contest, [MATE ROV Competition][6] and the [Intelligent Car Racing][7].

According to [[4]][link 4] - <br/>
ABU Robocon - is an Asia-Pacific based university level robotics competition, founded in 2002 by Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union. Each year the competition has different topics, but generally speaking two or more robots must be used to complete the tasks. One of the robots would be manual control while the others are automatic.

MATE ROV - challenges K-12, community college, and university students from all over the world to design and build ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicle) to tackle missions modeled after real-life scenarios from the marine environment.

Intelligent Car Racing - aims to encourage students to apply circuit design, mechanics knowledge, embedded software programming, and control theories in smart model car racing. The fastest car to complete the track without derailing wins the competition.

As mentioned HKUST Robotics team consist of academically very strong students, due to this reason team has many awards:

How to get into the team? <br/>
Each year in the fall semester they recruite new students to their team. Usually there are more 1st year students who would like to join, much less 2nd year students, and almost no 3rd or 4th year students. This is because being part of Robotics team is a lot of commitment and it has huge workload and it is considered as too late to come on 3rd or 4th year. The recruitment process goes by filling online application, then being called by Robotics members for an interview. In successfull pass of interview, they gather all possible newcomers and divide them into the teams of around 10 and assign them supervisors. Throughout fall semester possible newcomers have weekly lectures and practices. Until the end of the semester they try to build a functioning robot for an internal competition organized by robotics team to evaluate possible newcomers. Based on the performance on the lectures and final competition, new members for the Robotics team are selected. If you would like to know how serious competition is and how much skill throughout lectures and additional gatherings with supervisors possible newcomers need to learn to compete, here is a video of an internal competition to select newcomers.

Here is a description of the video: <br/>
This annual competition is a part of the new member recruitment process for the HKUST Robotics Team. Despite the challenging task of this yearâ€™s competition, which consisted of developing two different robots, training members were able to come up with amazing robot designs and there were a lot of exciting moments throughout the competition as they demonstrated their unique techniques. <br/>
The senior members of the Robotics Team supported the training members throughout the preparation and development of their robots, providing them with tutorials on electronics, mechanics and software programming. The senior members were also largely involved in organizing the competition.
