<h4>Ways to use executable</h4>
<p>
Load an image.</br>
<b>Right mouse</b> - for first seed and following seeds. </br>
Enter - finish the current contour.</br>
Ctrl+Enter - finish the current contour as closed.</br>
Backspace - when scissoring, delete the last seed; otherwise, delete selected contour.</br>
Select a contour by moving onto it. Selected contour is red, un-selected ones are green.</br>
</p>

<h4>Structure of the code</h4>
<p>
The tools used: C++, FLTK, OpenGL.<br>
The code is built on top of skeleton code given for comp4411<br>
We have djkstra(.h, .cpp) helper functions for building path trees given seed and all other rutines related to dijkstra algorithm.<br>
We have seed(.h, .cpp) class to maintain lines drawen to generate contour/mask for saving, during restoring image when backspace is pressed, and to restore images during zooming in/out.<br>
PointBrush.cpp - handles drawing, backspaces, enter, enter+ctrl by maintaining data structures<br>
PaintView.cpp - actually catches events and calls Pointbrush<br>
